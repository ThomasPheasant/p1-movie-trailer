## Art Direction

* Audience?
1. Pg-13 and above

* How should they feel?
2. They should get chills. Feel the theme of the horror movie.

* Color?
3. Should be dark colors mostly with maybe some funky attributes to show the craziness of the Dr. Suess world. REd and plues and purples with black for horror. Yellow, White, Red, Green, or Blue for the Dr. Suess.
